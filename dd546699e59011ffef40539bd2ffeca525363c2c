      "message": "Isn\u0027t this change just ignoring one of the cores?  Seems like we should be using the hotter of the two temperatures (read both and use highest).  Does it need to correlate the big core with specific little cores?  (not sure how to map them)",

      "message": "It still does both.  Say the instance ID is 5, then we get\ncoreNum \u003d 5 / 2 \u003d 2\ntempNum \u003d 5 % 2 \u003d 1\n\nso that would give proc_0_core_2_1_temp.  I\u0027m pretty sure that is the correct mapping, though I guess I should confirm.\n\nThe commit message shows more examples.\n\nI guess if we do just want the  max it might simplify users, I can ask around.",
