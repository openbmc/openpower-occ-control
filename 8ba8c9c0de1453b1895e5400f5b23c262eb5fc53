      "message": "There will be one OCCStatus object per OCC, so maybe you can just count those instead?  Ideally it would also know if the OCCs were active, so you wouldn\u0027t have to check it yourself here.\n\nThis would at least solve the immediate problem of how this code would know how many OCCs are in the system.  We still need to solve it for the OCCStatus objects, but maybe Chris can take a crack at that.",
